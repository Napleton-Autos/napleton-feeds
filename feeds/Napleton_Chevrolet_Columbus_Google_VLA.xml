It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!

It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift.  With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane.

Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that's both convenient and safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Lane departure prevention - Keep it between the lines. It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift.  With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane.  Lane departure prevention is an extra level of safety for you and those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly.

It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift.  With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane.
