Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Meet your ultimate co-pilot; GPS linked cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Unresponsive driver assistant - a reaction to inaction. Maybe you fell asleep. Maybe you lost consciousness. No matter how it happens, Unresponsive driver assistant works to help lessen the danger when it does. It detects prolonged driver unresponsiveness, automatically bringing the vehicle to a stop and turning on the hazard lights. If equipped, emergency services will also be contacted.
