You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that's both convenient and safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that's both convenient and safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Lane departure prevention - Keep it between the lines. It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift.  With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane.  Lane departure prevention is an extra level of safety for you and those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly.

Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-off cruise control - Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now with hands-off cruise control simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles with minimal steering input from you. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-off cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\nEMISSIONS, FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS, ENGINE, 2.5L TURBO DOHC SIDI WITH VARIABLE VALVE TIMING (VVT), TRANSMISSION, 8-SPEED AUTOMATIC, WHEELS, 22&quot; (55.9 CM) HIGH GLOSS BLACK PAINTED ALUMINUM, POLAR WHITE TRICOAT, SEATS, FRONT BUCKET, RS JET BLACK WITH TORCH RED ACCENTS, PERFORATED LEATHER-APPOINTED SEAT TRIM, LPO, FLOOR LINER PACKAGE, SUNROOF, POWER, DUAL GLASS, PANORAMIC, SLIDING, WITH POWER SUNSHADE, LPO, BLACK NAMEPLATE KIT, LICENSE PLATE FRONT MOUNTING PACKAGE, LPO, ALL-WEATHER FLOOR LINERS, FIRST AND SECOND ROW, LPO, ALL-WEATHER FLOOR LINER, THIRD ROW, LPO, INTEGRATED CARGO LINER\n \n&lt;b&gt;Napleton Saint Charles Chevrolet &lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities throughout the Chicagoland area.
