You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that's both convenient and safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Lane departure prevention - Keep it between the lines. It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift.  With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane.  Lane departure prevention is an extra level of safety for you and those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly.

    <ns0:description>The Napleton Auto Group promotes a no pressure buying experience that puts the customer in charge of the buying process, and for over 80 years, the Napleton family has made sure that absolutely nothing is more important than our commitment to your satisfaction. Our staff members are professional in every sense of the word, and receive regular training, including factory certification, so they are truly knowledgeable about the vehicles we offer. We want every customer's experience to be as timely, comfortable and ultimately as satisfying as it possible can be. You'll see it in every department of every Napleton Auto Group dealership. We hope you'll join the thousands of other satisfied customers that buy and service their vehicles the Napleton way.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n \nThis 2026 Chevrolet Traverse AWD RS offered in Radiant Red Tintcoat will make a great addition to your family or business!\n\n&lt;u&gt;Be sure to take note of all this vehicle has to offer:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Convenience&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Unresponsive driver assistant - a reaction to inaction. Maybe you fell asleep. Maybe you lost consciousness. No matter how it happens, Unresponsive driver assistant works to help lessen the danger when it does. It detects prolonged driver unresponsiveness, automatically bringing the vehicle to a stop and turning on the hazard lights. If equipped, emergency services will also be contacted. Unresponsive driver assistant is safety that never sleeps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-off cruise control - Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now with hands-off cruise control simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles with minimal steering input from you. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-off cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\nENGINE, 2.5L TURBO DOHC SIDI WITH VARIABLE VALVE TIMING (VVT), RADIANT RED TINTCOAT\n \n&lt;b&gt;Napleton Saint Charles Chevrolet &lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities throughout the Chicagoland area.

Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that's both convenient and safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Lane departure prevention - Keep it between the lines. It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift.  With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane.

Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy.

Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now with hands-off cruise control simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles with minimal steering input from you. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane.

It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!

It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift.  With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane.

It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Wireless App-Connect (w/Apple CarPlay, Android Auto &amp; MirrorLink) smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n \n&lt;b&gt;Napleton Saint Charles Chevrolet &lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities throughout the Chicagoland area.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.
