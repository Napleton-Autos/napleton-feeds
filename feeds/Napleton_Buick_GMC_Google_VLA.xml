You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that's both convenient and safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Lane departure prevention - Keep it between the lines. It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift.  With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-off cruise control - Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now with hands-off cruise control simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles with minimal steering input from you. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-off cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Super Cruise hands-on cruise control with lane change&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\nENGINE, 6.2L ECOTEC3 V8, DOWNPOUR METALLIC\n \n&lt;b&gt;Napleton Crystal Lake Buick GMC&lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities throughout Northern Chicago &amp; Northeastern Illinois.

It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!

Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Meet your ultimate co-pilot; GPS linked cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Unresponsive driver assistant - a reaction to inaction. Maybe you fell asleep. Maybe you lost consciousness. No matter how it happens, Unresponsive driver assistant works to help lessen the danger when it does. It detects prolonged driver unresponsiveness, automatically bringing the vehicle to a stop and turning on the hazard lights. If equipped, emergency services will also be contacted. Unresponsive driver assistant is safety that never sleeps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-off cruise control - Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now with hands-off cruise control simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles with minimal steering input from you. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-off cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\nEMISSIONS, FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS, ENGINE, 2.5L TURBO DOHC SIDI, TRANSMISSION, 8-SPEED AUTOMATIC, WHEELS, 22&quot; X 8.5 (55.9 CM X 21.6 CM) PEARL NICKEL MACHINED ALUMINUM, TIRES, P275/45R22 ALL-SEASON, BLACKWALL, SEATS, FRONT BUCKET, SHEER/VERY DARK ATMOSPHERE, PERFORATED LEATHER-APPOINTED SEAT TRIM, 15&quot; DIAGONAL PREMIUM GMC INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM, SUPER CRUISE PACKAGE, DENALI RESERVE PACKAGE, SUSPENSION, PERFORMANCE, SUNROOF, POWER, PANORAMIC SUNROOF WITH SUNSHADE, NOT EQUIPPED WITH HEATED WIPER PARK, AUDIO SYSTEM FEATURE, BOSE PERFORMANCE 16-SPEAKER SYSTEM WITH SUB-WOOFER, SUPER CRUISE, A HANDS-FREE DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYSTEM FOR USE ON COMPATIBLE ROADS, REAR CAMERA MIRROR, DRIVER ATTENTION ASSIST, ENHANCED AUTOMATIC PARKING ASSIST\n \n&lt;b&gt;Napleton Crystal Lake Buick GMC&lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities throughout Northern Chicago &amp; Northeastern Illinois.

Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that's both convenient and safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly.
