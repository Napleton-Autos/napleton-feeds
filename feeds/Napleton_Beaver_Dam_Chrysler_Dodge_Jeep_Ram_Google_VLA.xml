Keep your hands warm in cold temperatures so you can ditch the mitts and get a firm grip with this heated steering wheel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Convenience&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Smart device and keyfob engine start control - Phone ahead.  Remotely start your vehicle's engine from the key fob or your smart device, ensuring your ride is ready to go when you get in. Now you can stay comfortable inside while your vehicle gets comfortable outside, ,thanks to Smart device and Keyfob engine start control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Power open and close liftgate - On-demand access. When your arms are full of cargo, the last thing you want to do is set it all down just to open the liftgate, then pick it all back up to load it in. By remotely opening and closing, power liftgate lets you skip straight to the loading. It also eliminates the awkward stretch to reach up for the liftgate to close it. Load and go with power open and close liftgate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Blind spot warning - Protect your blind side. You checked the mirror, looked over your shoulder and still nearly collided with the car next to you. Blind spot warning alerts you to the presence of a vehicle to your sides or rear so you know if you're about to make an unsafe lane change.  Replace fear and uncertainty with confidence and safety with blind spot warning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Wireless connectivity - Strike the cord.

Trying to drive with bulky winter gloves on isn't always easy.

When your arms are full of cargo, the last thing you want to do is set it all down just to open the liftgate, then pick it all back up to load it in. By remotely opening and closing, power liftgate lets you skip straight to the loading. It also eliminates the awkward stretch to reach up for the liftgate to close it. Load and go with power open and close liftgate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Keyfob engine start control - Get an early start.  Remotely start your vehicle's engine from the key fob, ensuring your ride is ready to go when you get in.

When your arms are full of cargo, the last thing you want to do is set it all down just to open the liftgate, then pick it all back up to load it in. By remotely opening and closing, power liftgate lets you skip straight to the loading. It also eliminates the awkward stretch to reach up for the liftgate to close it. Load and go with power open and close liftgate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;In-car Entertainment&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Entertainment system with Blu-ray and digital media - Keep boredom at bay.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that's both convenient and safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle's infotainment system.  Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you're looking for while keeping your eyes on the road.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n &lt;b&gt;Napleton Beaver Dam CDJR&lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities that include Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay, Kenosha, Racine, Appleton, Waukesha, Oshkosh, Eau Claire, Janesville, West Allis, La Crosse, Sheboygan, Wauwatosa, Fond du Lac, New Berlin, Brookfield, Wausau, Beloit, Greenfield, Manitowoc, Franklin, Oak Creek, West Bend, Sun Prairie, Superior, Stevens Point, Neenah, De Pere, Mequon and Chicagoland area.

    <ns0:description>The Napleton Auto Group promotes a no pressure buying experience that puts the customer in charge of the buying process, and for over 80 years, the Napleton family has made sure that absolutely nothing is more important than our commitment to your satisfaction. Our staff members are professional in every sense of the word, and receive regular training, including factory certification, so they are truly knowledgeable about the vehicles we offer. We want every customer's experience to be as timely, comfortable and ultimately as satisfying as it possible can be. You'll see it in every department of every Napleton Auto Group dealership. We hope you'll join the thousands of other satisfied customers that buy and service their vehicles the Napleton way.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This 2026 Jeep Compass Latitude Altitude offered in Red Hot Pearlcoat will make a great addition to your family or business!\n\n&lt;u&gt;Be sure to take note of all this vehicle has to offer:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_package_name&quot;&gt;Quick Order Package 29N Altitude ($1,995 value)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul  class=&quot;vc_build_package_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Altitude Special Edition&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sliding Sun Visors W/Illuminated Mirrors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neutral Gray Exterior Badging&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gloss Black Surround/neutral Gray Rings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Day Light Opening Moldings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10.1&quot; Touchscreen Display&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Piano Black Interior Accents&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Comfort&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Heated steering wheel - A warm touch.

When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Voice activated integrated navigation system - A to B made easy!

No more bulky, impossible-to-fold maps, and no more stopping to ask for directions. Just tell it where you want to go, and the voice activated integrated navigation system shows you the right way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Wireless connectivity - Strike the cord. Wireless technology makes it easy to place calls without having to fumble with your phone. It integrates your device with the system inside your vehicle for hands-free access.
