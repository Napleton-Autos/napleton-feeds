Maybe you fell asleep. Maybe you lost consciousness. No matter how it happens, Unresponsive driver assistant works to help lessen the danger when it does. It detects prolonged driver unresponsiveness, automatically bringing the vehicle to a stop and turning on the hazard lights. If equipped, emergency services will also be contacted. Unresponsive driver assistant is safety that never sleeps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-off cruise control with lane change - Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now with hands-off cruise control with lane change simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles with minimal steering input from you. It slows you down; speeds you up, and helps you make lane changes. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-off cruise control with lane change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; SYNC 4 AppLink/Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\nENGINE: 3.5L V6 ECOBOOST, AGATE BLACK METALLIC\n &lt;b&gt;Napleton Downtown Chevrolet Buick GMC&lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities throughout the Chicagoland area.

Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful, until cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed using the steering wheel mounted controls and it will maintain that speed without driver intervention. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Resting your right foot is right at your fingertips thanks to cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Brake assist - Stop right there.  Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now!  With brake assist, you will.  It uses the speed of the brake pedal's travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car.

This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Resting your right foot is right at your fingertips thanks to cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Brake assist - Stop right there.  Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now!  With brake assist, you will.  It uses the speed of the brake pedal's travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Driver Attention Alert - Snap To it. Sometimes the drive is boring, sometimes you're tired, sometimes your mind starts to drift. Driver attention alert uses sensors to monitor the vehicle and/or driver's behavior and will flash or sound a warning to help keep you focused on the road ahead. Driver Attention Alert helps ensure your car doesn't drift when you do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-off cruise control - Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now with hands-off cruise control simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles with minimal steering input from you. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-off cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Super Cruise hands-on cruise control with lane change&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\nEMISSIONS, FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS, ENGINE, 5.3L ECOTEC3 V8, TRANSMISSION, 10-SPEED AUTOMATIC, REAR AXLE, 3.23 RATIO, WHEELS, 22&quot; X 9&quot; (55.9 CM X 22.9 CM) POLISHED ALUMINUM, TIRES, 275/50R22SL ALL-SEASON, BLACKWALL, ONYX BLACK, SEATS, FRONT BUCKET, JET BLACK, CORETEC/PERFORATED LEATHER-APPOINTED SEATING, AUDIO SYSTEM, 16.8&quot; DIAGONAL PREMIUM GMC INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM, ELEVATION PREMIUM PACKAGE, TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE, LPO, FLOOR LINER PACKAGE, MAX TRAILERING PACKAGE, TRANSFER CASE, ACTIVE, 2-SPEED ELECTRONIC AUTOTRAC, TRAILER BRAKE CONTROLLER, INTEGRATED, COOLING SYSTEM, EXTRA CAPACITY, LPO, WHEEL LOCKS, SET OF 4, SUNROOF, POWER PANORAMIC, DUAL-PANE, TILT-SLIDING, LICENSE PLATE FRONT MOUNTING PACKAGE, REAR SEAT MEDIA SYSTEM, SEATS, SECOND ROW BUCKET, POWER RELEASE, SEATS, HEATED AND VENTILATED DRIVER AND FRONT PASSENGER, SEAT ADJUSTER, DRIVER 4-WAY POWER LUMBAR, SEAT ADJUSTER, FRONT PASSENGER 4-WAY POWER, CONSOLE, FLOOR, POWER-SLIDING CENTER, LPO, ALL-WEATHER FLOOR LINERS, 1ST AND 2ND ROWS, LPO, ALL-WEATHER FLOOR LINERS, 3RD ROW, HEAD-UP DISPLAY, 15&quot; DIAGONAL MULTI-COLOR, SMART TRAILER INTEGRATION INDICATOR, SUPER CRUISE, REAR CAMERA MIRROR, INSIDE REARVIEW AUTO-DIMMING, LPO, ALL-WEATHER CARGO MAT, 3 YEARS ONSTAR ONE, HITCH VIEW, HILL DESCENT CONTROL, BLIND ZONE STEERING ASSIST WITH TRAILERING, DRIVER ATTENTION ASSIST\n \nCome and check out our full selection of new vehicles! &lt;b&gt;Napleton Downtown Chevrolet Buick GMC&lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities throughout the Chicagoland area.
