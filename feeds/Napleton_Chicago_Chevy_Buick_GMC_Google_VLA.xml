Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane.

Maybe you fell asleep. Maybe you lost consciousness. No matter how it happens, Unresponsive driver assistant works to help lessen the danger when it does. It detects prolonged driver unresponsiveness, automatically bringing the vehicle to a stop and turning on the hazard lights. If equipped, emergency services will also be contacted. Unresponsive driver assistant is safety that never sleeps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-off cruise control with lane change - Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now with hands-off cruise control with lane change simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles with minimal steering input from you. It slows you down; speeds you up, and helps you make lane changes. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-off cruise control with lane change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; SYNC 4 AppLink/Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\nENGINE: 3.5L V6 ECOBOOST, AGATE BLACK METALLIC\n &lt;b&gt;Napleton Downtown Chevrolet Buick GMC&lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities throughout the Chicagoland area.

Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Meet your ultimate co-pilot; GPS linked cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Audi smartphone interface (Apple CarPlay/Android Auto) smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n\n &lt;b&gt;Napleton Downtown Chevrolet Buick GMC&lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities throughout the Chicagoland area.

It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.

Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Meet your ultimate co-pilot; GPS linked cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-off cruise control with lane change - Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now with hands-off cruise control with lane change simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles with minimal steering input from you. It slows you down; speeds you up, and helps you make lane changes. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-off cruise control with lane change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\nEMISSIONS, FEDERAL, ENGINE, NONE (ELECTRIC MOTORS), DUAL LEVEL CHARGE CORD, DUAL-MODE, PORTABLE, TRANSMISSION, NONE (ELECTRIC DRIVE UNIT), WHEELS, 18&quot; X 9&quot; BLACK ALUMINUM, TIRES, LT305/70R18 GOODYEAR WRANGLER TERRITORY MT, TIRE, SPARE, LT305/70R18-126/123R, 35&quot; M/T, MOONSHOT GREEN MATTE, SEATS, FRONT BUCKET WITH CENTER CONSOLE, PREMIUM, LUNAR SHADOW (JET BLACK/TAUPE), PREMIUM LEATHER-ALTERNATIVE SEATING SURFACES, AUDIO SYSTEM, 13.4&quot; DIAGONAL PREMIUM GMC INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM WITH GOOGLE BUILT IN APPS SUCH AS NAVIGATION AND VOICE ASSISTANCE, GMC HUMMER EV EDITION 1, EXTREME OFF-ROAD PACKAGE, LPO, ILLUMINATION PACKAGE, FRONT DRIVE UNIT, 1-MOTOR, INTEGRATED INVERTER, PARK SYSTEM, LOCKING DIFFERENTIAL., FRONT DIFFERENTIAL, DRIVER-SELECTABLE, ELECTRONICALLY LOCKING, REAR DIFFERENTIAL, DRIVER-SELECTABLE, ELECTRONICALLY LOCKING, LPO, REAR D-RING RECOVERY HOOK IN BLACK, ARTICULATING D-RING, FRAME MOUNTED, SKID PLATES, FULL UNDERBODY, LPO, WHEELS, 18&quot; TECH BRONZE WITH MACHINED FACE, WHEEL, SPARE 18&quot; X 9&quot; BLACK ALUMINUM WITH MACHINED ACCENTS, INFINITY ROOF, WITH REMOVABLE TRANSPARENT SKY PANELS, LPO, ROOF CROSS RAIL PACKAGE, LPO, ROCKER PROTECTORS WITH ASSIST STEPS, LPO, FRONT OFF-ROAD AUXILIARY LIGHTS, LPO, OUTSIDE REARVIEW MIRROR PROJECTION LIGHTS, LICENSE PLATE KIT, FRONT, LPO, ACCESSORY TOUCH-SCREEN CONTROL SWITCHES, LPO, INTERIOR LED LIGHTING KIT, FRONT FOOTWELL, LPO, SKY PANEL STORAGE SET FOR ETRUNK, UNDERBODY CAMERAS, TRAILER TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM\n \nCome and check out our full selection of new vehicles! &lt;b&gt;Napleton Downtown Chevrolet Buick GMC&lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities throughout the Chicagoland area.

Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you.
