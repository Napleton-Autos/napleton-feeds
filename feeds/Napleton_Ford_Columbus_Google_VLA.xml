No matter how it happens, Unresponsive driver assistant works to help lessen the danger when it does.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that's both convenient and safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; SYNC 4 AppLink/Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n \n&lt;b&gt;Napleton Columbus Ford&lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities that include Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay, Kenosha, Racine, Appleton, Waukesha, Oshkosh, Eau Claire, Janesville, West Allis, La Crosse, Sheboygan, Wauwatosa, Fond du Lac, New Berlin, Brookfield, Wausau, Beloit, Greenfield, Manitowoc, Franklin, Oak Creek, West Bend, Sun Prairie, Superior, Stevens Point, Neenah, De Pere, Mequon and Chicagoland area.

We hope you'll join the thousands of other satisfied customers that buy and service their vehicles the Napleton way.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; \nThis 2025 Ford Bronco Sport Big Bend offered in Eruption Green Metallic will make a great addition to your family or business!\n\n&lt;u&gt;Be sure to take note of all this vehicle has to offer:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_package_name&quot;&gt;Black Diamond Off-Road Package ($1,820 value)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul  class=&quot;vc_build_package_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;110V/400W AC Power Outlet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cargo Mat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class II Trailer Tow Package with Trailer Sway Control&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;17&quot; Carbonized Gray Painted Aluminum Wheels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2nd Row Carpeted Seatback&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Auxiliary Switches and Wiring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brush Guard&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Underbody Protection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cargo Management System (shelf/divider/table)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Front and Rear Black Bumpers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fender Tie Downs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interior Grab Handle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recovery Hooks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;225/65R17 All-Terrain Tires&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_package_name&quot;&gt;Equipment Group 200A&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul  class=&quot;vc_build_package_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;8-Speed Automatic Transmission&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1.5L EcoBoost Engine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cloth with Easy-To-clean Front Bucket Seats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AM/FM Stereo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that's both convenient and safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; SYNC 4 AppLink/Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n \n&lt;b&gt;Napleton Columbus Ford&lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities that include Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay, Kenosha, Racine, Appleton, Waukesha, Oshkosh, Eau Claire, Janesville, West Allis, La Crosse, Sheboygan, Wauwatosa, Fond du Lac, New Berlin, Brookfield, Wausau, Beloit, Greenfield, Manitowoc, Franklin, Oak Creek, West Bend, Sun Prairie, Superior, Stevens Point, Neenah, De Pere, Mequon and Chicagoland area.

Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you.

Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy.

When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Audi smartphone interface (Apple CarPlay/Android Auto) smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n \n&lt;b&gt;Napleton Columbus Ford&lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities that include Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay, Kenosha, Racine, Appleton, Waukesha, Oshkosh, Eau Claire, Janesville, West Allis, La Crosse, Sheboygan, Wauwatosa, Fond du Lac, New Berlin, Brookfield, Wausau, Beloit, Greenfield, Manitowoc, Franklin, Oak Creek, West Bend, Sun Prairie, Superior, Stevens Point, Neenah, De Pere, Mequon and Chicagoland area.

    <ns0:description>The Napleton Auto Group promotes a no pressure buying experience that puts the customer in charge of the buying process, and for over 80 years, the Napleton family has made sure that absolutely nothing is more important than our commitment to your satisfaction. Our staff members are professional in every sense of the word, and receive regular training, including factory certification, so they are truly knowledgeable about the vehicles we offer. We want every customer's experience to be as timely, comfortable and ultimately as satisfying as it possibly can be. You'll see it in every department of every Napleton Auto Group dealership. We hope you'll join the thousands of other satisfied customers that buy and service their vehicles the Napleton way.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; \nThis 2025 Ford Bronco Sport Outer Banks offered in Ruby Red Metallic Tinted Clearcoat will make a great addition to your family or business!\n\n&lt;u&gt;Be sure to take note of all this vehicle has to offer:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you.

Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them.

It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that's both convenient and safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Brake assist - Stop right there.  Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now!  With brake assist, you will.  It uses the speed of the brake pedal's travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Apple CarPlay Compatibility smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n \n&lt;b&gt;Napleton Columbus Ford&lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities that include Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay, Kenosha, Racine, Appleton, Waukesha, Oshkosh, Eau Claire, Janesville, West Allis, La Crosse, Sheboygan, Wauwatosa, Fond du Lac, New Berlin, Brookfield, Wausau, Beloit, Greenfield, Manitowoc, Franklin, Oak Creek, West Bend, Sun Prairie, Superior, Stevens Point, Neenah, De Pere, Mequon and Chicagoland area.
