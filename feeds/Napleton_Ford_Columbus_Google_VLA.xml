Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Meet your ultimate co-pilot; GPS linked cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Unresponsive driver assistant - a reaction to inaction. Maybe you fell asleep. Maybe you lost consciousness. No matter how it happens, Unresponsive driver assistant works to help lessen the danger when it does. It detects prolonged driver unresponsiveness, automatically bringing the vehicle to a stop and turning on the hazard lights. If equipped, emergency services will also be contacted. Unresponsive driver assistant is safety that never sleeps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; SYNC 4 AppLink/Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n \n&lt;b&gt;Napleton Columbus Ford&lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities that include Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay, Kenosha, Racine, Appleton, Waukesha, Oshkosh, Eau Claire, Janesville, West Allis, La Crosse, Sheboygan, Wauwatosa, Fond du Lac, New Berlin, Brookfield, Wausau, Beloit, Greenfield, Manitowoc, Franklin, Oak Creek, West Bend, Sun Prairie, Superior, Stevens Point, Neenah, De Pere, Mequon and Chicagoland area.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that's both convenient and safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear collision mitigation - It has your back.  Rear collision mitigation uses sensors to monitor the area behind you.  If it senses an impending crash, it activates certain features to help prevent a collision or reduce the severity of it. Put your worries behind you with rear collision mitigation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Brake assist - Stop right there.  Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now!  With brake assist, you will.  It uses the speed of the brake pedal's travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly.

Resting your right foot is right at your fingertips thanks to cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that's both convenient and safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Brake assist - Stop right there.  Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now!  With brake assist, you will.  It uses the speed of the brake pedal's travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!

Our staff members are professional in every sense of the word, and receive regular training, including factory certification, so they are truly knowledgeable about the vehicles we offer. We want every customer's experience to be as timely, comfortable and ultimately as satisfying as it possibly can be. You'll see it in every department of every Napleton Auto Group dealership. We hope you'll join the thousands of other satisfied customers that buy and service their vehicles the Napleton way.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; \nThis 2025 Ford Bronco Sport Big Bend offered in Azure Gray Metallic Tri-Coat will make a great addition to your family or business!\n\n&lt;u&gt;Be sure to take note of all this vehicle has to offer:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_package_name&quot;&gt;Convenience Package ($1,895 value)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul  class=&quot;vc_build_package_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;LED Fog Lamps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Front Driver/passenger Seat Back Map Pockets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heated 8-Way Power Driver's Seat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Premium Wrapped Steering Wheel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Universal Garage Door Opener (UGDO)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_package_name&quot;&gt;Equipment Group 200A&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul  class=&quot;vc_build_package_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;8-Speed Automatic Transmission&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1.5L EcoBoost Engine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cloth with Easy-To-clean Front Bucket Seats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AM/FM Stereo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;225/65R17 102H All Season BSW Tires&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;17&quot; Carbonized Gray-Painted Aluminum Wheel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that's both convenient and safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; SYNC 4 AppLink/Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n \n&lt;b&gt;Napleton Columbus Ford&lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities that include Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay, Kenosha, Racine, Appleton, Waukesha, Oshkosh, Eau Claire, Janesville, West Allis, La Crosse, Sheboygan, Wauwatosa, Fond du Lac, New Berlin, Brookfield, Wausau, Beloit, Greenfield, Manitowoc, Franklin, Oak Creek, West Bend, Sun Prairie, Superior, Stevens Point, Neenah, De Pere, Mequon and Chicagoland area.

Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly.

We hope you'll join the thousands of other satisfied customers that buy and service their vehicles the Napleton way.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; \nThis 2025 Ford Bronco Sport Outer Banks offered in Carbonized Gray Metallic will make a great addition to your family or business!\n\n&lt;u&gt;Be sure to take note of all this vehicle has to offer:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_package_name&quot;&gt;Ford Co-Pilot360 Assist 2.0&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul  class=&quot;vc_build_package_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;360-Degree Camera with Trail and Split View&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Front Parking Sensors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reverse Brake Assist&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_package_name&quot;&gt;Outer Banks Tech Package+ ($1,995 value)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul  class=&quot;vc_build_package_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;B&amp;O Sound System by Bang &amp; Olufsen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HD Radio&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Connected Navigation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_package_name&quot;&gt;Equipment Group 300A&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul  class=&quot;vc_build_package_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Premium Trimmed Front Bucket Seats W/ebony/roast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;8-Speed Automatic Transmission&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1.5L EcoBoost Engine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AM/FM Stereo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;225/60R18 All Season Tires Bsw&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;18&quot; Ebony Black Wheels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!

Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Meet your ultimate co-pilot; GPS linked cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Unresponsive driver assistant - a reaction to inaction. Maybe you fell asleep. Maybe you lost consciousness. No matter how it happens, Unresponsive driver assistant works to help lessen the danger when it does. It detects prolonged driver unresponsiveness, automatically bringing the vehicle to a stop and turning on the hazard lights. If equipped, emergency services will also be contacted. Unresponsive driver assistant is safety that never sleeps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; SYNC 4 AppLink/Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n \n&lt;b&gt;Napleton Columbus Ford&lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities that include Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay, Kenosha, Racine, Appleton, Waukesha, Oshkosh, Eau Claire, Janesville, West Allis, La Crosse, Sheboygan, Wauwatosa, Fond du Lac, New Berlin, Brookfield, Wausau, Beloit, Greenfield, Manitowoc, Franklin, Oak Creek, West Bend, Sun Prairie, Superior, Stevens Point, Neenah, De Pere, Mequon and Chicagoland area.

Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Meet your ultimate co-pilot; GPS linked cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Unresponsive driver assistant - a reaction to inaction. Maybe you fell asleep. Maybe you lost consciousness. No matter how it happens, Unresponsive driver assistant works to help lessen the danger when it does. It detects prolonged driver unresponsiveness, automatically bringing the vehicle to a stop and turning on the hazard lights. If equipped, emergency services will also be contacted. Unresponsive driver assistant is safety that never sleeps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-off cruise control with lane change - Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now with hands-off cruise control with lane change simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles with minimal steering input from you. It slows you down; speeds you up, and helps you make lane changes. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-off cruise control with lane change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Technology and Telematics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; SYNC 4 AppLink/Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Other notable features:&lt;/u&gt;\n\nENGINE: 3.5L V6 ECOBOOST, AGATE BLACK METALLIC\n \n&lt;b&gt;Napleton Columbus Ford&lt;/b&gt; is proud to serve customers in communities that include Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay, Kenosha, Racine, Appleton, Waukesha, Oshkosh, Eau Claire, Janesville, West Allis, La Crosse, Sheboygan, Wauwatosa, Fond du Lac, New Berlin, Brookfield, Wausau, Beloit, Greenfield, Manitowoc, Franklin, Oak Creek, West Bend, Sun Prairie, Superior, Stevens Point, Neenah, De Pere, Mequon and Chicagoland area.

    <ns0:description>The Napleton Auto Group promotes a no pressure buying experience that puts the customer in charge of the buying process, and for over 80 years, the Napleton family has made sure that absolutely nothing is more important than our commitment to your satisfaction. Our staff members are professional in every sense of the word, and receive regular training, including factory certification, so they are truly knowledgeable about the vehicles we offer. We want every customer's experience to be as timely, comfortable and ultimately as satisfying as it possibly can be. You'll see it in every department of every Napleton Auto Group dealership. We hope you'll join the thousands of other satisfied customers that buy and service their vehicles the Napleton way.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; \nThis 2025 Ford Bronco Sport Outer Banks offered in Oxford White will make a great addition to your family or business!\n\n&lt;u&gt;Be sure to take note of all this vehicle has to offer:&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n&lt;h4 class=&quot;vc_build_feature_name&quot;&gt;Safety and Security&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;vc_build_feature_item_list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you.

When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them.

It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.  When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident.  Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety.  Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!

Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you.

Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down; speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rear camera - Watching your back!  The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you.
